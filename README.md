# Project Title

Brief description of your project.

## Dataset

You can access the dataset used in this project link_to_the_dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/irkaal/foodcom-recipes-and-reviews?rvi=1

## Data Cleaning

The dataset underwent several cleaning steps to ensure its quality and reliability. The following procedures were applied:

- **Handling Missing Values:** Any missing values were identified and addressed appropriately, either through imputation or removal.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Duplicate records, if any, were identified and removed to maintain data integrity.

## Data Preprocessing

Before feeding the data into our models, it underwent preprocessing to make it suitable for analysis. Key preprocessing steps include:

- **Standardization:** Standardizing numerical features to have a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1.
- **Categorical Encoding:** Converting categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like one-hot encoding.
- **Feature Scaling:** Scaling features to a specific range for better convergence in machine learning models.

Feel free to explore the Jupyter Notebook or Python script in the `src` directory for a detailed walkthrough of the data cleaning and preprocessing steps.

```bash
   pip install pandas
   pip install numpy
